A web app that allows users to store their files on the Arweave blockchain using Boba tokens as payment through an intuitive and familiar interface.

This page will be updated soon

You can watch a screen record of how the app behaves on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/KiRGawT8k-w) .
A live demo will be deployed to our server shortly.
